Current versions are separated from another minor version.

Stable version for PHP lower than version 8.0 [ai4.6](https://github.com/9r3i/ai4.6)


# Contribution
This time, this AI console system is private function only.

But everyone can add their own code inside extension and library directory. While basic code of this system is PHP, AI will scan all php files in those directories and load-up as AI executing arguments.

I will release a development guide for detail.

This time, some of library sample has been create at [https://github.com/9r3i/aipkg](https://github.com/9r3i/aipkg)

And learn more about how to deploy to git host and add the repository as library to it to install on ai.


# Next Tasks
- End-User Manual
- Development Guide
- AI GUI Emulator (PARTLY-DONE)


# Closing
That's all there is to it. I'm really grateful to Allah, Alhamdulillaah...
